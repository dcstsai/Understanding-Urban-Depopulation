    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the code for our unsupervised learning/clustering analysis of cities. \n",
    "Our main research question is ***What are some ways we can cluster cities into categories based on all available data, and will this reveal any patterns about city development?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we took to answer this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**City size definition**\n",
    "We understand that the nature of cities is different based on their population size. Therefore, we divided the cities into 3 groups based on their population size: small, medium, and large, as we did in question 1. We then performed clustering analysis on each group of cities separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Transformation**\n",
    "We used the same data transformation process as we did in question 1. We first take the log of skewed variables, then standardize all variables using robust scaler. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Models**\n",
    "We used 4 different clustering models to cluster the cities. 2 of the models are taught in class (K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering), and we found 2 models that might be useful for our analysis in terms of finding non-spherical clusters (DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Model).\n",
    "The models we used and the methods we used to determine the optimal number of clusters and related parameters are as follows:\n",
    "1. ***K-means clustering***: we used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for each group of cities.\n",
    "2. ***Hierarchical clustering***: we used the dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters for each group of cities.\n",
    "3. ***DBSCAN***: we used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of eps for each group of cities.\n",
    "4. ***Gaussian Mixture Model***: we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the optimal number of clusters for each group of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion and Future Work**\n",
    "See bottom of the notebook."
